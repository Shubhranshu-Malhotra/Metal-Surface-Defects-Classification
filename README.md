# Metal-Surface-Defects-Classification
A project to identify and classify defects on metal surface using Deep Learning. This is a great application of AI for quality control in manufacturing industry.  
  
Automated defect inspection has been a hot area of research for quality control of industrial products across industries.  
This project aims to automatically detect metal surface defects such as rolled-in scale, patches, crazing, pitted surface, inclusion and scratches (as depicted in the image below) in Hot-Rolled Steel Strips. The defects are classified into their specific classes via a convolutional neural network (CNN).
